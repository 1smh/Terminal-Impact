NASA's 2025 budget cuts funding to the Chandra X-Ray Satellite. If approved, Chandra will shut down permanently. Chandra is the only deep space satellite capable of imaging using x-rays. X-rays are used to image black holes, supernovas, neutron stars, and galaxy clusters. Shutting down this extensive project would be a catastrophe to knowledge. 

What is Terminal Impact?
=======

Our game, Terminal Impact, aims to spread awareness of the significance of the Chandra satellite through an interactive simulation of the satellite's tasks. Terminal Impact takes you into an immersive journey through the cosmos to understand the critical impact of the satellite's invaluable contributions. From the game, we hope players will develop a deeper appreciation for astronomy and the importance of funding satellites. The goal of the game is to encourage players to advocate for continued funding and support for Chandra as it is crucial to developing our understanding of the universe (for reference, the Earth is only one octovigintillionth of the universe).

Our game was built in LOVE2D's game engine using Lua. All of this was built for the 8th Los Altos Hackathon inside a 24 hour timeframe. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

What can we do about this?

The site has information on how to contact Congress to reject the bill. The site also has other ways to spread awareness and make an impact in the mission to save Chandra.
